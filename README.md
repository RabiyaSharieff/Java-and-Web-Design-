**Java Appliations:**

**Chat Room**
1) The chat server will accept connections from clients on port 5190 and relay anything sent to the server to all clients (including the one who originally sent the message), with the sender's name prepended to the message.The server does not produce any output on the screen. Clients, upon connecting, have to announce their username, which is NOT be forwarded to the other clients. The server does not introduce itself, to the client!

2) Chat client for the above server. The client will have a top box which is displays all the messages from the clients, and a bottom input which will allow text to be written to the server.Upon starting the client,  asks which server to connect to and what username to use. When the client connects to the server it sends the username as the first message. After the first message is sent, anything received from the server is displayed in the top box and anything written in the bottom box (after the send button is pushed) is sent to the server.
